# Deployment to the Lattice infra

Lattice is used to provide elastic management of stateless services.
This docker container is used to wrap the deployment command of lattice so that it doesn't need to be deployed on the client.

This is a fairly low level piece, and will likely be wrapped up by higher level concerns fairly quickly

## Using the deployment container

docker run [imagelocation] -e LTC_HOST=XXX -e LTC_PASS=XXX -e LTC_USER=XXX -e LTCARG="container_name image_name -m 200 --no-monitor"

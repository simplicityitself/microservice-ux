## Your First Time with *Microservices UX*

It's never easy on your first time ... but we've done our best to make it as easy as possible to get up and running and using Microservices UX as quickly as possible. 

### Prerequisites

To get up and running with Microserives UX you'll need the following tools installed:

* https://git-scm.com[GIT]
* http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip[Ansible]
* https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant]
* A Virtualisation Provider such as https://www.virtualbox.org:[VirtualBox] for Vagrant to use.

### Running Microservices UX Locally for the First Time

Once you have the prerequisites installed open a terminal window use GIT to clone this repository using:

  > git clone https://github.com/simplicityitself/microservice-ux

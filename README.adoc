Building, Deploying and Maintaining Polyglot Microservices is *hard*. This project makes it *simple* and *easy*.

By curating ***best-of-breed infrastructure*** and blending in a ***coherent deployment and strong programming model***, Microservices UX helps you quickly ***gain the benefits of Microservices without the hassle***.

## Your First Time with *Microservices UX*

It's never easy on your first time ... but we've done our best to make it as easy as possible to get up and running and using Microservices UX as quickly as possible. 

### Prerequisites

To get up and running with Microserives UX you'll need the following tools installed:

* https://git-scm.com[GIT]
* https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant]
* A Virtualisation Provider such as https://www.virtualbox.org:[VirtualBox] for Vagrant to use.



### Get the base platform running locally within a vagrant virtual machine

  > mkdir muon-platform-demo
  > cd muon-platform-demo
  > vagrant box add muon-platform-demo https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8022259/muon-platform-demo.box
  > vagrant init muon-platform-demo
  > vagrant up
 
 
### Youre done! Time to Kick the tyres!

Navigate to the muon platform portal page to take a test drive around the platform's core services.

  > http://localhost:8080/ 



### Now, do somethign useful! 

Next, lets get a demo mciroservices app deployed and running.

  > git clone https://github.com/simplicityitself/microservice-ux
  > cd microservice-ux/demoApp
  > Readme.adoc
  
  
  
### And there's more! Exploring under the hood...  

using the muon command to disover
  
  > vagrant ssh
  > root@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64: muon -d local discover
